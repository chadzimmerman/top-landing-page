Final TOP Landing Page Practice Test

With this test I plan to build, from TOP's instructions, a 4-element website completely from scratch. It will have a header, three content elements of text, sign-ups and photos, a sticky footer element, and it will be positioned with flex-box. The CSS style is provided, but they allow flexibility in the use of images and content of the website. As such, I will use this as a chance to build a landing page for a website-blocking chrome app that is free for all to use.
